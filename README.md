Recipes for Salads On The Go - Quick, Easy, Healthy!!!

## What's Salads On The Go - 
The last few years (2016, 2017) have presented great learning opportunities for me. I've embarked on an important personal journey which has taken me down paths I would never considered travelling before. That journey for me has just begun and personally I have a long way to go with a lot more to learn and experience along the way. This site is in many ways has taken birth through that personal journey of mine and intends to simply offer a collection of easy to make Salads On The Go. 

Secondly,eating healthy while travelling has always been an interesting challenge for me. Personally, I've been in the consulting space for the last 16+ years working with clients large, small around the world delivering projects/programs of various sizes. Of the 16+ years, the last ~7 years has involved a fair amount of travelling across the large landmass called Australia and to some extent across ASEAN, mostly for purposes of work. While travelling I make it a point to stay at serviced apartments (As far as possible) which allows me to store packed food (which i take along with me) that usually covers diners for the nights I am out of the house. What's then left is sorting out the lunches for each of the days of the week that I am travelling. This website offers a listing of the various recipes I've pulled together as an answer to that question of, "Quick, Easy, Healthy" meals.

Growing up I've never been much of a salad eater. It's only in the last couple of years as part of the dietary overhaul, I've taken to salads of different kinds. My travelling for work combined with change in my lifestyle requires that I seriously consider putting together healthy means for my afternoon lunches. The society we live in makes it very easy to access fast food or comfort food on the go, that's tastes good but isn't necessarily either healthy or nutricious for our body. Little do we realize that a lot of the food around is engineered to taste the way it does, harming our bodies and minds as a consequence.
